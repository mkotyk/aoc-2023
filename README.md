Advent of Code 2023

This year the goal is to solve each puzzle using C, and then trying to compile and run the solution on a variety of vintage computers.

The selection of vintage computers are all from the late 1980's and have a C compiler available.

- ~Commodore Amiga 500 (1MB expansion ram, internal Gotek "Floppy", external Floppy, Lattice C 4.0)~
- Commodore PC 40-III (286, 1MB ram, 100MB HDD, 1.2M & 720K Floppy, MS-DOS 4.0, Turbo C 2.0)
- Macintosh SE FDHD (68000, 4MB ram, 4.5GB** HDD, 1.4M Floppy, System 7.1, Symantec Think C)
- ~Apple IIgs (65C816, 2MB ram, 20MB floppy emu HDD, 800K Floppy, Prodos, ORCA-C)~

** Orignal 20MB hard drive died and was replaced

Amiga is out.  The C compiler couldn't parse anything.
Apple IIgs is out, there are no self hosted C compilers available.
